V1.2.0 (dev release)
--------------------

 * Initial support of the |Xyce|_ simulator.  Xyce is an open source, SPICE-compatible,
   high-performance analog circuit simulator, capable of solving extremely large circuit problems
   developed at Sandia National Laboratories.  Xyce will make PySpice suitable for industry a
   research use.
 * Fixed OSX support
 * Implemented partially `A` XSPICE device
 * Implemented missing transmission line devices
 * Implemented high level current sources
   **Notice: Some class were renamed!**
 * Implemented raw spice pass through (see `User FAQ </faq.html>`_)
 * Implemented check for missing ground node
 * Improved SPICE parser
 * Added Numpy array support to unit
 * Splitted G device
 * Fixed device shortcuts in `Netlist` class
 * Fixed subcircuit nesting

V1.1.0 (stable release)
-----------------------

 * Enhanced shared mode
 * Shared mode is now set as default on Linux

V1.0.0
------

 * Bump version to v1.0.0 since it just works!
 * Support Windows platform using Ngspice shared mode
 * Fixed shared mode
 * Fixed and completed Spice parser : tested on example's libraries

V0.4.2
------

 * Fixed Spice parser for lower case device prefix.

V0.4.0
------

 * Git repository cleanup: filtered generated doc and useless files so as to shrink the repository size.
 * Improved documentation generator: Implemented :code:`format` for RST content and Tikz figure.
 * Improved unit support: It implements now the International System of Units.
   And we can now use unit helper like :code:`u_mV` or compute the value of :code:`1.2@u_kÎ© / 2@u_mA`.
   The relevant documentation is on this `page <api/PySpice/Unit.html>`_.
 * Added the Simulation instance to the Analysis class.
 * Refactored simulation parameters as classes.

V0.3.2
------

 * fixed CCCS and CCVS

V0.3.1
------

 * fixed ngspice shared

V0.3.0
------

 * Added an example to show how to use the NgSpice Shared Simulation Mode.
 * Completed the Spice netlist parser and added examples, we could now use a schematic editor
   to define the circuit.  The program *cir2py* translates a circuit file to Python.
